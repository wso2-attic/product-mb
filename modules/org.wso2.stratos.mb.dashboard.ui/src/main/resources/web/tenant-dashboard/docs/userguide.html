<h1>Business Rules Server Home</h1>

<p>
Separating business rules from infrastructure code boosts the agility of an enterprise by increasing the ability to smoothly evolve. The WSO2 Business Rules Server is the easiest way to bring rule processing and SOA together by exposing rules as services and allowing rules to act upon message flows. The WSO2 Business Rules Server provides a "Wizard interface" for easily exposing a rule as a service, a rule repository including versioning and rollback, governance and lifecycle management, Web 2.0 community features including the ability to share, tag, comment on and rate rules, standard SOA interoperability and Quality of Service (QoS) including secure and reliable WS-* and REST services, and many more.
