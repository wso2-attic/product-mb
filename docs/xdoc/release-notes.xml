            <h1>WSO2 Message Broker (MB) 3.0.0 RC2 Released!</h1>

            <p>
                The WSO2 Message Broker team is pleased to announce the 3.0.0 RC2 release of WSO2 Message Broker (MB).
            </p>
            <p>WSO2 Message Broker (WSO2 MB) v 3.0.0  is fast, lightweight and user friendly open source
                distributed message brokering system under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">
                Apache Software License v2.0</a>. WSO2 MB allows system administrators and developers to
                easily configure jms queues and topics which could be used in message routing, message stores,
                message processors. It also supports transport ws eventing. WSO2 MB is compliant with Advanced
                Message Queueing Protocol Version 0-91 and Java Message Service Specification version 1.1.
            </p>
            <p>
                WSO2 MB v 3.0.0 is developed on top of the revolutionary
                <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a> (Middleware a' la carte),
                an OSGi based framework that provides seamless modularity to your SOA via
                componentization. This release also contains many new features and a range of optional
                components (add-ons) that can be installed to customize the behavior of the MB. Further, any
                existing features of the MB which are not required to your environment can be easily
                removed using the underlying provisioning framework of Carbon. In brief, WSO2 MB can
                be fully customized and tailored to meet your exact SOA needs.
            </p>
