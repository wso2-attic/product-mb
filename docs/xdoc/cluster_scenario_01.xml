      <h2>Starting external cassandra server and zoo keeper server and point all broker nodes to them</h2>
      <p>
          In this model you need to get downloaded following apache products
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li><a href=" http://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html#download">Apache Zoo Keeper</a> <p> Version 3.3.4</p></li>
          <li><a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/download/">Apache Cassandra</a><p> Version 1.0.*</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p> Deployment model will be like bellow </p>
      <p>
          <img src="images/cluster_scenario_01.png" alt="Cluster Setup Scenario 01" height="600" width ="950"/>
      </p>
      <p> In this model we have a common cassandra server and a common zoo keeper server. Both of them can be in a same
       host or in different hosts. Eg: Lets say they are in two different hosts as bellow</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Cassandra Server - 192.168.0.100</li>
          <li>Zoo Keeper Server - 192.168.0.101</li>
      </ul>
      <p> We have three Message Broker servers in three different hosts as</p>
       <ul>
          <li>MB Server 01 - 192.168.0.102</li>
          <li>MB Server 02 - 192.168.0.103</li>
          <li>MB Server 03 - 192.168.0.104</li>
      </ul>

      <p> We need to configure cassandra server to listen to all the broker nodes.For that we need to change the following entries
      in the "Cassandra.yaml" file which is located in the "apache-cassandra-1.0.1/conf/" directory.</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Change the data storage directories of cassandra. Here by default it will point to the location "/var/lib/". But
          it will be better, if you can keep the data locally inside the folder where you have the server setup. So change it to "./repository/database" off
          all three entries as</li>
          <pre>
              # directories where Cassandra should store data on disk.
              data_file_directories:
                  - ./repository/database/cassandra/data

              # commit log
              commitlog_directory: ./repository/database/cassandra/commitlog

              # saved caches
              saved_caches_directory: ./repository/database/cassandra/saved_caches

          </pre>

          <li>Change listen address of the server. By default it is "localhost", change it to the ip address of the host where you
          have the cassandra server.
          </li>
          <pre>
             listen_address: 192.168.0.100
          </pre>

          <li>Change RPC address of the server.By default it is "localhost", change it to the ip address of the host where you
          have the cassandra server. </li>
           <pre>
             rpc_address: 192.168.0.100
          </pre>
      </ul>
      <p> Now save the cassandra.yaml file and you can start the cassandra server by executing the script "cassandra" with the
          option -f.  Eg: "./cassandra -f"
      </p>

      <p> Then we need to configure the Zoo Keeper Server to listen to all broker nodes. We can do it by renaming the "zoo_sample.cfg"
      file which can be found at "zookeeper-3.3.4/conf" folder to "zoo.cfg" and do the following modification in that file
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>Change the data directory to store data local to the installation directory</li>
          <li>Add the entry "clientPortAddress" by providing the ip of the localhost</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After modifying the file , it will look like bellow. </p>
      <pre>
            # The number of milliseconds of each tick
            tickTime=2000
            # The number of ticks that the initial
            # synchronization phase can take
            initLimit=10
            # The number of ticks that can pass between
            # sending a request and getting an acknowledgement
            syncLimit=5
            # the directory where the snapshot is stored.
            dataDir=./../data
            # the port at which the clients will connect
            clientPort=2181

            clientPortAddress=192.168.0.101
        </pre>
      <p>
          Once you done the above changes, you can save the file and start the zookeeper server by executing the "zkServer.sh" script
          with the option start. eg: sh zkServer.sh start
      </p>

      <p>
          Then you need to do the following configuration changes in each Message broker nodes
      </p>
      <p>
         Modify andes-config.xml file which is located at : /repository/conf/advanced directory as bellow
      </p>
      <ul>

          <li>Enable clustering</li>
          <li>Change the server of the Zookeeper</li>
      </ul>
      <pre>
          &lt;clustering>

          &lt;enabled><b>true</b>&lt;/enabled>
          &lt;OnceInOrderSupportEnabled>false&lt;/OnceInOrderSupportEnabled>
          &lt;externalCassandraServerRequired>true&lt;/externalCassandraServerRequired>

          &lt;coordination>
              &lt;!-- Apache Zookeeper Address -->
              &lt;ZooKeeperConnection><b>192.168.0.101</b>:2181&lt;/ZooKeeperConnection>
              &lt;!-- Format yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss -->
              &lt;ReferenceTime>2012-02-29 08:08:08&lt;/ReferenceTime>
          &lt;/coordination>
      </pre>

      <p>Modify andes-virtualhosts.xml file which is located at :/repository/conf/advanced directory as bellow</p>
       <ul>
          <li>Change the connection string by pointing to the cassandra server</li>
      </ul>
      <pre>
          &lt;store>
              &lt;class>org.wso2.andes.server.store.CassandraMessageStore&lt;/class>
              &lt;username>admin&lt;/username>
              &lt;password>admin&lt;/password>
              &lt;cluster>ClusterOne&lt;/cluster>
              &lt;idGenerator>org.wso2.andes.server.cluster.coordination.TimeStampBasedMessageIdGenerator&lt;/idGenerator>
              &lt;connectionString><b>192.168.0.100</b>:9160&lt;/connectionString>
          &lt;/store>
      </pre>

      <p>Now you can start all three Message Broker nodes.</p>
